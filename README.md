   2. Open the terminal in the project folder and run the command npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
   3. Run the command npm start to start the Expo server.

## Features

The mobile app has the following features:

   - Add new tasks to the list
   - Mark tasks as completed
   - Remove tasks from the list

## Limitations

The mobile app is still in development and has some limitations:

   - The task list is stored in a local database and is not shared between different devices.
   - It is not possible to edit or update tasks that have already been added.
   - The mobile app does not yet have user authentication, which means that anyone can add, mark or remove tasks from the list.
